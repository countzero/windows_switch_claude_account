# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Common Changelog](https://common-changelog.org),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [4.0.0] - 2026-09-08

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: `#Requires -Version` bumped from 7.2 to 7.4. `[System.IO.File]::SetUnixFileMode`, which the Linux file-permission fix depends on, needs .NET 7; 7.4 is the lowest LTS release carrying it, and both 7.2 and 7.3 are past end of life.
- **BREAKING**: `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is now honoured, on Windows as well as Linux. Claude Code reads this variable to relocate its whole config tree, `.credentials.json` and `.claude.json` included, so a session with it set was already billing an account `sca` could not see. Anyone who has the variable set will find `sca` reading a different directory than before, and their existing slots in the default `~/.claude` no longer listed. The value is used exactly as given: a leading `~` is not expanded and a relative path resolves against the current directory, matching Claude Code rather than correcting it. When the variable relocates the directory, `sca` prints one line naming the directory in use and counting the slots left behind, so the move is never silent.
- Linux is supported. `~` resolves via `$env:HOME` there and `%USERPROFILE%` on Windows, slot enumeration passes `-Force` so the dotfiles this tool owns are visible, and `sca install` writes the alias block with the platform's own line ending.
- The `FILES` section of `sca help` prints the paths this invocation actually uses instead of hardcoded `%USERPROFILE%` literals, so it stays correct on both platforms and under `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`.

### Added

- macOS is refused with an explanatory error rather than misbehaving. Claude Code stores credentials in the encrypted Keychain there, so replacing `.credentials.json` has no effect and `switch` would have reported success while Claude Code kept authenticating and billing the previous account.
- A test workflow running the suite on `windows-latest` and `ubuntu-latest`. No workflow ran the tests before.

### Fixed

- Credential files are no longer written world-readable on Linux. Every file `sca` writes goes through an atomic rename, which on Unix is a bare `rename(2)`, so the destination inherits the temp file's mode: under the usual `0022` umask that silently downgraded Claude Code's `0600` to `0644` and left live refresh tokens readable by every user on the machine. The temp file is now created `0600` by `open(2)` itself, so the bytes are never readable by anyone but the owner, not even for the duration of the write. Covers `.credentials.json`, slot files, identity sidecars, the state file, and `~/.claude.json`.
- Three `sca save` tests asserted that a file count was zero using an enumeration that cannot see dotfiles on Linux, so they would have passed whether or not the files existed.

## [3.2.1] - 2026-09-08

### Changed
- `sca usage -Json` reports a slot's failure reason in full. A reason classified from a `claude -p` activation was truncated to 200 characters while the seven other failure paths emitted the raw message; the bound belongs to each renderer, which applies it at its own width, so the row itself now keeps the text intact.

### Fixed
- The per-slot reason lines under `sca usage` no longer discard real failures in favour of configuration notices, nor the reverse. Slots were listed in name order and cut off after three, so a pool whose alphabetically-first slots use an API key showed three identical `api key or non-claude.ai slot` lines and dropped the transport errors from the slots after them. The two kinds are now separated: a per-slot message is still capped at three lines, while `expired` / `unauthorized` / `no-oauth` are grouped onto one line per status naming every slot that shares it. Those three statuses have no condition line above the reason block, so a shared cap could drop the only on-screen explanation of the one failure class that does not clear on its own.
- A context-window or tool-output failure from `claude -p` is no longer misreported as `rate-limited`. The plan-limit classifier matched a bare "limit reached", which appears in those messages too, and a slot marked throttled is quietly re-probed on the next poll instead of being reported.
- `[Watch] Last poll failed:`, `[Monitor] Rotation failed!` and `[Warmup] Re-warm failed!` no longer break the footer layout when the underlying exception spans several lines. The footer is split on newlines so each entry can be coloured, which forked one multi-line message into several unprefixed lines.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-09-07

### Changed
- The `Status` column of `sca usage` renders short fixed labels only (`error`, `error <code>`, `expired`, `unauthorized`, `no-oauth`), matching what the README always documented. The reason a slot failed now prints below the table as `[Usage] <slot>: <reason>`, up to three slots. Status is the last column and its width also sizes the Session / Week bars, so one long cell wrapped both its own row and the two bars; the reason itself was cut mid-word at 60 characters, which was the case that made this visible ("`error: You've hit your session limit · resets 6:10pm (Europe/Berlin...`").

### Fixed
- `sca monitor -KeepWarm` no longer reports a slot that has hit its Claude.ai session or weekly limit as a hard `error`. Claude Code phrases those as "You've hit your session limit", which says neither "rate limit" nor "429", so the classifier missed it: such a slot now shows `rate-limited` in yellow, keeps its reset time visible on the advisory line, and is re-probed once its window may have rolled instead of being written off. The advisory also no longer claims the usage API could not be read for a slot whose usage was never read.
- The aggregate Session / Week bars no longer overflow the terminal. They fit to the table, but the table is content-sized, so a long slot name or a wide status pushed the bar past the right edge and it wrapped onto a second line.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-08-04

### Changed
- A single slow `/api/oauth/usage` response no longer erases a slot's numbers. A failed read now falls back to the last known percentages instead of collapsing the row to `error: The request was canceled due to the configured HttpClient.Timeout...`. The endpoint answers in 46-2108 ms in practice, so the previous shared 5-second budget left almost no headroom; usage now gets 12 seconds and the token refresh gets its own 15.
- When nothing is cached, a failed usage read retries once only if a second immediate attempt can plausibly answer differently: a `5xx` (Anthropic's `529 Overloaded` clears in seconds) or a codeless transport failure. A timeout is not retried, because it has already spent the full budget and slots are polled serially, so retrying it doubled every slot's contribution to the first frame of a watch; nor is a `4xx`, which the server rejects identically the second time.
- Auto-rotation reads a slot's cached percentages when a live read fails, instead of treating every non-`ok` row as 0% utilized. A throttled or briefly unreachable active slot at 100% now rotates rather than freezing. Rotation still refuses to move *into* a slot it could not verify.
- A bucket whose reset time has already passed counts as 0% for rotation and keep-warm decisions, so cached data cannot report a slot as exhausted after its window has rolled.
- `sca monitor -KeepWarm` no longer spends a billable `claude -p` on a slot that is already at the rotation threshold: warming re-opens the 5h window, which achieves nothing when that window is open and full.
- The usage advisory prints one line per condition instead of letting the cache-fallback line suppress everything else, and distinguishes a failed live read from an Anthropic rate limit.
- `sca usage -Json` may now emit `data` on a row whose `status` is `"error"`. Such a row always carries `is_cached_fallback: true`, which remains the only freshness marker.

### Fixed
- `sca monitor` no longer goes silently inert when the active slot's usage cannot be read. It previously kept displaying the last `Rotated from ... to ... at ...` line while being structurally unable to rotate; it now reports `[Monitor] Active slot usage unknown (<status>); rotation paused.`
- The aggregate Session/Week bars no longer present one account's numbers as the whole pool when another slot's read fails transiently.
- The compact `error <code>` status label (for example `error 529`) now actually renders. `HttpStatus` was dropped when building snapshot rows, so the label was unreachable and every coded failure fell back to a truncated .NET sentence.
- A poll that outran `-Interval` pre-credited the interval with its own duration, so the watch loop re-polled immediately with no delay. The interval is now measured from when the poll finished.
- A network timeout no longer stamps a rate-limit backoff, which had suppressed live probing for two minutes and mislabelled the slot as throttled.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- `sca usage -Watch` and `sca monitor` no longer flash to black and repaint row by row on a heavily loaded machine. Each frame is now painted as a single in-place overwrite (cursor-home, per-line erase, no full-screen clear), so the terminal can never be caught showing a half-drawn frame; DEC 2026 synchronized output is now a bonus on capable terminals rather than the sole safeguard.
- The live watch renders the aggregate bars (`█` / `▓`), the auto-rotation `▶` indicator, and the `…` / `—` glyphs correctly instead of as `?` on a legacy OEM codepage (e.g. CP850); it now writes UTF-8 to the console and restores the previous encoding on exit.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- `sca monitor` action: the live, side-effecting supervisor. It always auto-rotates to the next eligible slot when the active slot reaches `-Threshold` (default 95), and `-KeepWarm` additionally keeps every slot warm by re-opening closed 5h windows on each poll. Auto-rotation remains OpenCode-scoped and refuses to run while Claude Code is open.

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `sca usage` is now read-only. It keeps `[name]`, `-Watch`, `-Interval`, and `-Json`; the live auto-rotation and keep-warm modes moved to the new `sca monitor` action.
- **BREAKING**: auto-rotation is invoked as `sca monitor` (rotation is unconditional, so there is no `-Auto` flag) instead of `sca usage -Watch -Auto`. Tune the rotation point with `sca monitor -Threshold <n>`.
- **BREAKING**: keep-warm is invoked as `sca monitor -KeepWarm` instead of `sca usage -Watch -Warmup`.
- The auto-rotation watch footer is now labelled `[Monitor]` (was `[Auto]`); the keep-warm footer keeps the `[Warmup]` label it shares with the standalone `warmup` action.
- `sca` help corrects the FILES section to the real slot filename (`.credentials.<name>(<email>).json` plus the `.account.json` sidecar and `.sca-state.json` state file).

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: the `-Auto`, `-Threshold`, and `-Warmup` flags on `sca usage`. Use `sca monitor` / `sca monitor -Threshold <n>` / `sca monitor -KeepWarm`.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- `sca warmup [name]` action: opens each saved slot's 5h session window (or just `<name>`) and prints the usage table. Refuses while Claude Code is running or the `claude` CLI is absent.

### Changed
- Warmup now opens a slot's 5h window by running the real Claude Code CLI (`claude -p` on Haiku in safe-mode, ~$0.004/slot) instead of a raw `/v1/messages` request, delegating the OAuth refresh to Claude Code's own flow. A throttled slot is reported and skipped, not retried.
- The `sca usage` rate-limit advisory moved into the watch footer as a single line that fits the table width.
- Agent instructions now live in `AGENTS.md`; `CLAUDE.md` is a thin `@AGENTS.md` import shim so Claude Code loads the same content.

### Fixed
- `sca usage` shows a short `error <code>` label (e.g. `error 529`) for HTTP errors instead of a verbose .NET message that wrapped the table row.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added
- `sca usage -Watch -Warmup` primes every saved slot before polling so the first frame shows real Session/Week percentages instead of empty cells. Each prime sends a minimal billable `/v1/messages` request (~2 tokens per slot). Combines with `-Auto`; refused while Claude Code is running.

### Changed
- A transient `429` now keeps a slot's last-known Session/Week percentages on screen (marked, status stays `rate-limited`) instead of blanking the row to em-dashes.

### Fixed
- A `429` during token refresh retries with backoff and self-recovers within the same poll, instead of leaving the slot stuck on `rate-limited` until the next command.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- `sca -Version` prints the version string instead of `True`, and every other action no longer emits a red `InvalidArgument` error at startup. The internal version constant collided with the `[switch] $Version` parameter; renamed to `$Script:ScriptVersion`.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- `-Version` flag prints `$Script:Version` and exits.

### Changed
- `sca usage -Watch -Auto` title shows the pool mean across HTTP-ok slots, not the active slot.
- Pool-mean math extracted into `Get-PoolMeanUtilization`, shared by `Format-AggregateBars` and `Format-WatchTitle -Aggregate`.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added
- `sca usage -Watch -Auto [-Threshold <1..100>]` auto-rotates to the next eligible slot when the active slot's utilization reaches the threshold (default 95).
- Right-aligned `▶ switching slot at N%` header indicator and latched `[Auto] …` footer line on the watch frame when `-Auto` is set.
- `Invoke-SlotSwap` extracted from `Invoke-SwitchAction` as the shared atomic swap primitive used by `sca switch` and the auto-rotation step.
- `docs/images/usage-watch-auto.svg` rendered example for the auto-mode watch frame; promoted to the README hero image.

### Changed
- `sca switch` output no longer ends with the cyan `[Info]` apply hint.
- README restructured: dashboard hoisted above the fold, watch content relocated into the Usage subsection, disclaimer blockquote-styled, Support section reframed.
- README usage screenshots rendered at a uniform 720px canvas and pinned to 1× intrinsic width via the HTML `width` attribute.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- MIT license.
- GitHub Sponsors and Ko-fi funding via `.github/FUNDING.yml`.
- Unofficial-tool disclaimer and Anthropic-ToS discretion note in README.

### Changed
- Project canonically renamed to "Switch Claude Account". Profile-installer block markers renamed from `# === Claude Account Switcher ===` to `# === Switch Claude Account ===`. Existing installs: re-run `sca install` on the new version, then manually remove the leftover old-marker block from `$PROFILE`.

### Fixed
- `sca save` rolls back to the pre-existing slot pair when the sidecar write fails after the tokens-file write. The previous behaviour (delete-then-write) could leave the user with no slot for a name on a transient AV / disk-full / share-violation persisting past the 3-attempt retry on `Set-CredentialFileAtomic`.
- `sca usage` emits a yellow advisory pointing at `sca save` / `sca switch` when an OAuth refresh rotates tokens for the active slot but the slot's `.account.json` sidecar is missing (so `Find-SlotByName` returns null and `.credentials.json` is not updated). Previously the rotation silently desynchronised, forcing a Claude Code re-login on its next own-refresh.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- GitHub Actions workflow `release-assets.yml` attaching `switch_claude_account.ps1` to each published release (skips pre-releases; `workflow_dispatch` fallback for backfill).
- `plan-review` skill for second-pass review of multi-step plans.
- Cross-project agent conventions: scratch-file discipline under `.tmp/sessions/<id>/`, multi-agent working-tree rules, version-control basics, em-dash punctuation rule.
- Explicit `@`-references in `CLAUDE.md` so OpenCode picks up `.claude/rules/script-internals.md` and `.claude/rules/tests.md` (Claude Code already auto-loads them).
- LF line-ending enforcement via `.gitattributes`.

### Changed
- Empty progress-bar cells render with U+2593 DARK SHADE instead of U+2591 LIGHT SHADE for cell-uniform width with U+2588 FULL BLOCK in terminal fonts.
- `sca usage -Watch` footer collapsed to a single advisory line.
- README screenshots regenerated against actual `Format-AggregateBars` and `Format-UsageTable` output; use ASCII space for empty bar cells for GitHub render alignment.
- Em-dash punctuation rule applied across docs, script, and tests; rate-limit advisory repunctuated from em dash to semicolon.
- Refreshed `pr-code-review` skill with metadata header, severity glyphs, and Pass-1 test-coverage check.
- README Download section replaced with a click-to-download link to `releases/latest/download/switch_claude_account.ps1`, which serves `Content-Disposition: attachment` via `objects.githubusercontent.com`.

### Removed
- `next in Xs` countdown footer from `sca usage -Watch`.

### Fixed
- Stale `Format-WatchTitle` prose claiming pool-mean across slots; the watch-mode title shows the active slot only.
- Unreachable `api-key / no-oauth` row in the lower README screenshot (slots without OAuth are refused at save time).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- State file at `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\.sca-state.json` (schema v1) as the single source of truth for which slot is active; auto-migrates from 1.x installs on first read by content-hashing `.credentials.json` against existing slot files.
- Atomic-rename credential-file writes via `MoveFileEx`, surviving the share-delete handle Claude Code holds on `.credentials.json` while running. Retry policy: 3 attempts with 50 ms backoff.
- Reconcile pass that mirrors active credentials into the tracked slot or auto-saves under `auto-<UTC-timestamp>(<email>)` on cross-account swap; fires before `usage`, `switch`, and `list`.
- Active-slot OAuth-refresh propagation into `.credentials.json` with paired state-hash update, so the next reconcile no-ops.
- Identity sidecars `.credentials.<name>(<email>).account.json` capturing the slot's whitelisted `oauthAccount` snapshot at save time and restoring it to `~/.claude.json` on `sca switch`. Tokens-then-sidecar atomic-pair invariant: sidecar-write failure rolls back the tokens file.
- Identity resolution at save time reads `~/.claude.json`'s `oauthAccount` block first (offline) and falls back to `/api/oauth/profile` only when the cache is empty; both failing refuses the save.
- Targeted regex substitution into `~/.claude.json`'s `oauthAccount` block via `MatchEvaluator`, preserving every other byte (project history, mcp configs, ~50 other fields). Null-valued whitelisted fields are skipped.
- `-NoColor` flag and `NO_COLOR` env-var support via `$PSStyle.OutputRendering = 'PlainText'`.
- `Write-Color` helper routing all colored output through inline SGR codes; replaces 33 `-ForegroundColor` call sites.
- `Write-VTSequence` helper bypassing PowerShell's `StringDecorated.AnsiRegex` so DEC private modes survive regardless of `OutputRendering`.
- Flicker-free `sca usage -Watch` via DEC 2026 synchronized output mode and alternate screen buffer; pre-watch scrollback restored on Ctrl-C.
- Watch-mode terminal title via OSC 0, with `[!]` / `[~]` alarm prefix when any bucket crosses `UtilLimitPct` / `UtilWarnPct`.
- 429 cache-fallback path covering both `/api/oauth/usage` and `/v1/oauth/token`; non-429 refresh failures route through 60-char tail truncation so timeouts and 5xx no longer wrap the table.
- `is_cached_fallback` field on `-Json` rows served from cache; rate-limit advisory retitled to the endpoint-agnostic "Anthropic API rate limited".
- `[CmdletBinding()]`, parameter sets separating `-Json` from `-Watch`, and `[ValidateRange(1, [int]::MaxValue)]` on `-Interval`.
- Path-scoped agent rules under `.claude/rules/` (`script-internals.md`, `tests.md`) with per-path triggers; root `CLAUDE.md` trimmed from 390 to 122 lines.
- Pester suite: 36 new cases covering state-file atomic-rename behaviour, reconcile branches, `-NoColor` / `NO_COLOR`, watch-mode VT rendering, null-sidecar preservation, and refresh-429 / cache-fallback paths.
- `tests/Measure-Complexity.ps1` advisory AST walker reporting LOC, McCabe CC, and max nesting per function.

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: active-slot tracking moved from NTFS hardlinks to a state file. The hardlink approach was structurally fragile against Claude Code's atomic-rename token-refresh writes, which silently detached `.credentials.json` from any hardlink graph.
- **BREAKING**: `#Requires -Version` bumped from 7.0 to 7.2 for `$PSStyle.OutputRendering` support.
- **BREAKING**: synthetic `<active>` row removed from the `sca usage` data model. Reconcile guarantees the active credentials live in a real slot before rendering, so `<active>` and `<active> (unsaved)` argument aliases are no longer accepted.
- **BREAKING**: slots without a valid sidecar are hidden from `list` / `usage` / rotation and refused by `switch`. Re-running `sca save <name>` while the slot is active recaptures the sidecar.
- `sca save` and `sca switch` no longer require closing Claude Code to update `.credentials.json`, but still refuse to operate while it is running because they read/write `~/.claude.json`'s `oauthAccount` block.
- `Invoke-Reconcile` now fires on `list` as well so cross-account swaps surface in the active-marker column on the next render.
- Cross-account identity comparison uses the sidecar email as source of truth, not the filename email.
- `Invoke-RemoveAction` refuses to delete the slot tracked as active in state, and walks the raw filesystem so sidecar-less legacy slots can still be cleaned by name.
- Reset-delta rendering: `in 2h 37m` becomes `(2h 37m)`, matching the rest of the table.
- Top-level `Param` block migrated to PowerShell-idiomatic shape: PascalCase names, explicit `[Parameter(Position = …)]` for `Action` / `Name`.
- `-NoColor` flag spelled `-nocolor` for consistency with `-help` / `-json` / `-watch` / `-interval`.
- `Get-Slots` is now a thin enumerator: no per-slot SHA-256 hashing, sources `IsActive` from state, and silently sweeps leftover `.credentials.*.profile.json` cache sidecars from v1.
- README rewritten for the state-file plus sidecar model; CLAUDE.md split into root plus path-scoped rules.

### Removed
- `Test-HardlinkSupport` and its preflight call sites; non-NTFS volumes are no longer rejected.
- Synthetic-slot machinery in `Get-UsageSnapshot` / `Format-UsageFrame` and the `-SuppressAdvisory` parameter.
- Hardlink-broken / `not hardlinked to any slot` / `ActiveLocked` advisories from `sca list`.

### Fixed
- Token-refresh 429 from `/v1/oauth/token` no longer surfaces as wrapped `expired:` rows; classified via `Test-Is429` and routed through the cache-fallback path.
- Watch-mode color rendering on Windows. `Write-Host -ForegroundColor` called `SetConsoleTextAttribute` out-of-band, landing on a different channel than the buffered cell writes inside the DEC 2026 sync envelope; inline SGR codes via `Write-Color` now render correctly.
- `sca usage -Watch -nocolor` no longer flickers. `OutputRendering = 'PlainText'` was stripping DEC private modes via `StringDecorated.AnsiRegex`; `Write-VTSequence` bypasses the filter.
- `Set-OAuthAccountInClaudeJson` no longer wipes Claude Code's cached `oauthAccount` fields when the sidecar carries nulls (e.g. from the `/api/oauth/profile`-fallback save path).
- Token-sync propagation-failure advisory rewritten: now names `sca switch <slot>` as the recovery and states the realistic refresh-token rotation consequence (Claude Code's next own-refresh fails with 401).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- `usage` action reporting live 5-hour Session and 7-day Week plan-usage percentages per slot via Anthropic's undocumented `GET /api/oauth/usage`. Auto-refreshes expired OAuth tokens against `platform.claude.com/v1/oauth/token`.
- `sca usage -watch` live self-refreshing view with 1 s redraw cadence and `-interval`-controlled polling (default and floor 60 s); refuses non-interactive output.
- `sca usage <name>` verbose single-slot view with `Account`, `Status`, `Session`, and `Week` rows including absolute local-timezone reset stamps.
- Pool-wide aggregate Session and Week progress bars rendered above the `sca usage` summary table.
- Plan-usability `Status` column (`ok`, `near limit`, `limited 5h`, `limited 7d`, `limited`, `expired`, `unauthorized`, `error: …`, `no-oauth`) derived from `UtilWarnPct = 90` and `UtilLimitPct = 100` thresholds.
- Synthetic `<active>` row when `.credentials.json` is not hardlinked to any saved slot, addressable via `sca usage '<active>'` for verbose drill-down.
- OAuth account email embedded in slot filenames as `.credentials.<slot>(<email>).json`; resolved at save time via `GET /api/oauth/profile` and rendered in a new `Account` column.
- `sca list` rebuilt as `Slot | Account` table sharing layout with `Format-UsageTable`.
- `sca switch` output rebuilt with DarkYellow header, post-switch saved-slot table, and cyan `[Info]` hint as the last line.
- 429 rate-limit resilience in `Get-SlotUsage`: per-slot in-memory cache reused with a yellow `displaying cached data` advisory.
- `(` and `)` sanitized in user-provided slot names to avoid filename-grammar ambiguity.
- `Get-UsageSnapshot` / `Format-UsageFrame` / `Invoke-UsageWatch` split: pure data, pure rendering, thin timing loop.
- Pester suite split into per-action files; total 152 in-process tests.

### Changed
- Section-title headers recolored from Yellow to DarkYellow; Yellow reserved for advisories. Green / Red / Cyan / DarkGray roles codified.
- Help screen `FILES` section emits literal `%USERPROFILE%` placeholders instead of interpolating the running user's name.
- README expanded with `usage`, `usage -watch`, aggregate-bar, Status-column, Account-column, and synth-row sections.
- `.claude/worktrees/` added to `.gitignore`.

### Fixed
- `save` no longer aborts when the `/api/oauth/profile` response carries an email with NTFS-invalid characters or when a labeled slot file is locked. Slot persists unlabeled with a yellow advisory; success line no longer claims an email label that did not land on disk.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- `Test-HardlinkSupport` preflight for `save` and `switch` failing early on filesystems that cannot create hardlinks (FAT32, most network shares).
- `list` warns when `.credentials.json` is no longer hardlinked to any saved slot and suggests `sca switch <name>` to repair auto-sync.

### Changed
- `save` and `switch` replace `.credentials.json` with a hardlink to the named slot file instead of copying bytes; OAuth token refreshes flow into the saved slot through the shared inode.
- Slot names containing `[` or `]` are sanitized to `_`; all credential-file operations use `-LiteralPath` as defense-in-depth.
- README documents `sca switch` (no name) auto-rotation in its own subsection.

### Fixed
- `uninstall` preserves profile line endings byte-for-byte via raw regex splice instead of `Get-Content` + `-join "`r`n"`, no longer converting LF or mixed-ending profiles to CRLF.
- Test suite restores `$env:USERPROFILE` and `$global:PROFILE` in `AfterAll` so interactive `Invoke-Pester` runs do not leak the sandbox into the caller's session.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- Single-file PowerShell switcher with `save`, `switch`, `list`, `remove`, `install`, `uninstall`, and `help` actions.
- Named credential slots stored as `.credentials.<name>.json` under `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\`.
- Auto-rotation: `sca switch` without a name rotates to the next saved slot alphabetically, wrapping.
- Help screen as default action plus `-h` / `--help` switch.
- `sca` and `switch-claude-account` aliases installed into the PowerShell profile via marker-delimited block.
- Windows filename sanitization with reserved device-name rejection (`CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`, `NUL`, `COM1-9`, `LPT1-9`).
- Profile install / uninstall preserving existing encoding (UTF-8 with or without BOM, UTF-16 LE/BE) and refusing to mutate on orphan markers.
- Pester 5 test suite (65 in-process tests) with auto-install and sandboxed `$env:USERPROFILE` / `$PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts` per test.
- Optional PSScriptAnalyzer advisory pass in the test runner.
- README with installation, usage, workflow, Windows notes, and testing sections.
- `CLAUDE.md` with agent guidance for repo structure, gotchas, and script-shape conventions.
