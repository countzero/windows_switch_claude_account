A zero-dependency PowerShell utility for Claude Code on Windows that combines secure multi-account management with a live usage dashboard and automated limit-based rotation.

</p>

## Features

**Account & identity**

- **Identity-aware slots**: each slot's OAuth email is captured at save time, baked into the filename, and locked in a sidecar; what you see in `list` is guaranteed to be who the tokens actually belong to
- **Named slots with rotation**: unlimited accounts under any name (Windows-invalid characters auto-sanitized); `sca switch` with no name cycles through them alphabetically

**Live usage monitoring**

- **Live plan-usage dashboard**: `sca usage -Watch` polls Anthropic's `/api/oauth/usage` and renders a flicker-free, auto-refreshing view of Session (5h) and Week (7d) limits across every slot; the terminal-tab title is updated each poll so a backgrounded watch is glanceable from the taskbar / Alt-Tab
- **Transparent token refresh**: expired access tokens are refreshed before usage queries and mirrored back into the active credentials file

**Automation**

- **Auto-reconcile**: silently captures Claude Code's hourly token refreshes into the tracked slot; auto-saves cross-account swaps under a timestamped name so you never lose state
- **Smart rotation (OpenCode only)**: `sca monitor` auto-rotates to the next eligible slot when the active one hits a usage threshold (default 95%); refuses to run while Claude Code is open
- **Cold-slot warmup**: `sca warmup` (and `sca monitor -KeepWarm`) opens each dormant slot's 5h window by running the real Claude Code CLI, so Anthropic reports usage data for every account (billable)

**Reliability & footprint**

- **Atomic-safe writes**: slot-file updates use `MoveFileEx` with retry so they survive a running Claude Code on `.credentials.json`; `save` / `switch` still refuse to run while it's open to protect `~/.claude.json`
- **Zero dependencies**: pure PowerShell 7.2+, no external packages, no companion assets

## Installation

### Requisite

**Requires PowerShell 7.2+.** Stock Windows ships PowerShell 5.1, which is not supported. Install PS 7 via `winget install Microsoft.PowerShell`, then run from `pwsh`.

### Download

[Download latest switch_claude_account.ps1](https://github.com/countzero/windows_switch_claude_account/releases/latest/download/switch_claude_account.ps1) and place it anywhere on disk.

> [!TIP]
> Check the [releases page](https://github.com/countzero/windows_switch_claude_account/releases) for older versions.

### Manual (run once)

```powershell
.\switch_claude_account.ps1 install
```

This adds `sca` (short) and `switch-claude-account` (long) aliases to your PowerShell profile. Close and reopen your terminal to activate them.

### Without alias

```powershell
.\switch_claude_account.ps1 <action> [name]
```

## Usage

### Save an account

Log into an account in Claude Code, **close Claude Code**, then save:

```powershell
sca save work
sca save personal
sca save test-project
```

`save` refuses to run while Claude Code is open and refuses to save a slot whose identity it cannot resolve from `~/.claude.json` (primary) or `/api/oauth/profile` (fallback). There are no unlabeled-no-identity slots. To rename a slot: `sca switch old-name; sca save new-name; sca remove old-name`.

### List saved slots

```powershell
sca list
```

The active slot is marked with `*` (sourced from `~/.claude/.sca-state.json`). Slots whose identity sidecar is missing or invalid are hidden from the list, from rotation, and from `switch`; re-running `sca save <name>` while that slot is active recaptures the sidecar.

### Switch to a slot

```powershell
sca switch work
```

`switch` refuses to run while Claude Code is open. It atomically writes the slot's bytes into `.credentials.json` AND restores the slot's captured `oauthAccount` block into `~/.claude.json` so Claude Code's `/status` shows the matching email.

### Rotate to the next slot

```powershell
sca switch
```

Without a name, `switch` activates the next slot in alphabetical order and wraps from the last back to the first. The current position comes from `state.active_slot`.

### Remove a slot

```powershell
sca remove test-project
```

`remove` refuses to delete the slot tracked as currently active.

### Identity capture: who is each slot actually logged in as?

Slot names are user-assigned labels; nothing stops you from naming a slot `work` and later overwriting it with credentials for a completely different account. At `sca save` time the tool pulls the OAuth email from `~/.claude.json`'s `oauthAccount` block (Claude Code's own cache) and embeds it in the slot filename:

```
%USERPROFILE%\.claude\.credentials.work(ada.lovelace@arpa.net).json
```

A paired sidecar `.credentials.work(ada.lovelace@arpa.net).account.json` holds the full whitelisted identity (`accountUuid`, `emailAddress`, `organizationUuid`, `displayName`, `organizationName`) so `sca switch` can restore the matching `oauthAccount` block to `~/.claude.json`. Because the email is captured at save time and carried in both the filename and sidecar, it cannot drift from the OAuth tokens; the only way to update a slot's email label is to re-run `sca save`.

When the slot name already equals the OAuth email, the filename is deduplicated to `.credentials.alice@example.com.json` and the `Account` column shows `—`.

### Check plan usage

```powershell
sca usage                         # one-shot table for every slot
sca usage work                    # verbose single-slot block (Session / Week, absolute reset times)
sca usage -Json                   # machine-readable per-slot output
sca usage -NoColor                # strip ANSI color (also: $env:NO_COLOR='1')
```

The output shows the 5-hour session limit (`Session` column, "Current session" in Claude Code's `/usage`) and the 7-day weekly all-models limit (`Week` column, "Current week (all models)") as percentages of each account's Claude.ai subscription:

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/usage-table.svg" alt="sca usage one-shot: green pool-aggregate Session bar at 10% and Week bar at 24%, then a two-row table showing active 'work' (green) and inactive 'personal' (gray)" width="720">
</p>

Decoding the output:

- **Pool-aggregate bars**: sum utilization across HTTP-ok slots over `N × 100%`. Bar color: green &lt;50%, yellow ≥50%, red ≥90%.
- **Active marker (`*`)**: sourced from `~/.claude/.sca-state.json`; appears at the start of the row and inherits the row's color.
- **`Account` column**: the OAuth email captured at save time. Shows `—` when the email equals the slot name (deduped filename), the actual email otherwise.
- **`Session` / `Week` cells**: `<pct>% <delta>`. The delta is `(2h 11m)` under 24h with minute precision, `(102h)` at 24h+ with integer hours, `now` if the reset is past, or `—` when no data is available.
- **`Status` column**: one of `ok`, `near limit` (≥90%), `limited 5h` / `limited 7d` (≥100%), `error`, `expired`, `unauthorized`, `rate-limited`, or `no-oauth`. Status drives the entire row's color.

Drill into a single slot for absolute reset times in your local timezone:

```powershell
sca usage work
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/usage-verbose.svg" alt="sca usage work: yellow [Usage] header, dim Account line, green Status: ok, then Session and Week rows with absolute reset times in Europe/Berlin" width="720">
</p>

`list`, `switch`, `usage`, `warmup`, and `monitor` (per poll) run a quiet **reconcile** pass before doing their work: if `.credentials.json` has changed since the last sync (Claude Code refreshed a token, or you logged into a different account inside Claude Code), the new bytes are captured into the tracked slot, or auto-saved under `auto-<UTC-timestamp>(<email>).json` if the email differs.

> [!WARNING]
> **Unofficial API.** `sca usage` calls `api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`, the same endpoint Claude Code's `/usage` uses internally. Undocumented by Anthropic and may break on Claude Code upgrades; when that happens, see the extraction recipe at the top of `switch_claude_account.ps1` to re-pin the constants. The endpoint is not a public API and may be changed or withdrawn at Anthropic's discretion; use accordingly.

> [!NOTE]
> **Token refresh.** If a slot's access token has expired (default TTL ~1h), `sca usage` transparently refreshes it against `platform.claude.com/v1/oauth/token` and mirrors the new tokens back into both the slot file and `.credentials.json` via atomic rename so the active session keeps working.

### Watch plan usage live

Execute `sca usage -Watch` to enable the live dashboard:

```powershell
sca usage -Watch                  # live, self-refreshing view; Ctrl-C to quit
sca usage work -Watch             # follow a single slot
sca usage -Watch -Interval 300    # slower poll cadence (60s floor)
sca usage -Watch -NoColor         # strip ANSI color
```

The terminal-tab title is updated on every poll so a backgrounded watch is glanceable from the taskbar / Alt-Tab:

    22% | 62% | Switch Claude Account

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/usage-watch.svg" alt="sca usage -Watch: pool-aggregate Session bar at 22% (green) and Week bar at 62% (yellow), then a five-row slot table with the active 'work' row in green, two inactive 'ok' rows, one yellow 'near limit' row, one red 'limited 7d' row, and a [Watch] Last poll footer" width="720">
</p>

> [!NOTE]
> The title's numbers come from the **active** slot (or the slot named in `sca usage <name> -Watch`); a non-`ok` row falls back to the bare brand suffix. A `[~]` prefix appears when a bucket is ≥90%, `[!]` when ≥100%. Pre-watch title is restored on Ctrl-C.

### Warm up cold slots

Anthropic only reports `/api/oauth/usage` data for slots that have an open server-side 5h session window, which only a real message can open. Warmup automates the manual "switch to a slot, send one message" routine across every saved slot: for each slot it switches in and runs the real Claude Code CLI (`claude -p "Hi"` in safe-mode on Haiku, ~$0.004/slot), then restores the slot you started on. Because it runs the actual client, it opens the window exactly like you typing a message would.

```powershell
sca warmup                            # warm every slot once, print the table, exit
sca warmup slot-2                     # warm just one slot
sca monitor -KeepWarm                 # auto-rotate AND keep every slot warm for the whole watch
```

`sca monitor -KeepWarm` does more than the one-shot pass: at each poll it re-opens any slot whose 5h window has since closed, so a long session keeps every slot warm instead of letting them all expire ~5h after startup. (A 5h window can only be reopened *after* it closes, so a just-expired slot is re-warmed within one poll, not before.) A per-slot cooldown keeps a slot whose warm keeps failing from being retried every poll.

Both `sca warmup` and `sca monitor -KeepWarm` refuse to operate while Claude Code is running (the per-slot swap writes `~/.claude.json`) and require the `claude` CLI to be installed and logged in. A slot whose token refresh is temporarily rate-limited is reported and skipped, not retried. `-KeepWarm` is the typical companion to `monitor`: rotation needs every peer slot reporting real data to make good decisions, which keeping them warm guarantees.

### Auto-rotate on usage limit (OpenCode only)

`sca monitor` is a live watch that auto-rotates to the next eligible slot when the active slot's `max(Session, Week)` utilization hits the threshold. Rotation is what `monitor` is for, so it is always on (there is no `-Auto` flag); for a read-only live view use `sca usage -Watch` instead.

```powershell
sca monitor                  # rotate when active slot hits 95% (default)
sca monitor -Threshold 90    # rotate earlier on either bucket
sca monitor -KeepWarm        # also keep every slot warm (billable)
```

Peer slots are walked in alphabetical wrap order (same direction as `sca switch` without a name); peers that are themselves at or above the threshold are skipped, as are peers with non-`ok` HTTP status. When no peer is eligible, the footer surfaces the soonest reset across all slots as a cooldown ETA: `[Monitor] No free slot available! Cooling down for 1h 12m.`. The mode is indicated on every frame by a right-aligned `▶ switching slot at N%` header indicator plus a latched `[Monitor] …` footer line.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/monitor.svg" alt="sca monitor: same five-row slot table as the watch view, with a right-aligned '▶ switching slot at 95%' header indicator and a '[Monitor] Rotated from \"legacy\" to \"work\" at 14:31:58' footer line above the [Watch] Last poll line" width="720">
</p>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **OpenCode-scoped feature.** Requires [`opencode-claude-auth`](https://github.com/griffinmartin/opencode-claude-auth) **>= 1.5.4**, which re-reads `~/.claude/.credentials.json` on cache miss so a swap propagates to a running OpenCode process without restart. **Claude Code itself is NOT supported**: its in-memory `~/.claude.json` cache would race the swap, so `sca monitor` refuses to start (and to rotate mid-watch) while `claude.exe` is running. Close Claude Code before running `sca monitor`; OpenCode can keep running.

### Install / uninstall alias

```powershell
sca install      # Add aliases to your PowerShell profile
sca uninstall    # Remove aliases from your PowerShell profile
sca help         # Show usage info
```

## Workflow

### Saving accounts

1. Open Claude Code and log in with your first account
2. **Close Claude Code**
3. Run `sca save work`
4. Open Claude Code, log out, log in with a different account
5. **Close Claude Code**
6. Run `sca save personal`

If Claude Code is running when you invoke `save` or `switch`, the action exits immediately with a clear message; no partial writes occur.

### Switching between accounts

1. **Close Claude Code**
2. Run `sca switch work`
3. Open Claude Code: it now uses the `work` credentials and `/status` shows the matching email

### Why close Claude Code first?

`sca save` and `sca switch` read and write `~/.claude.json`'s `oauthAccount` block. Claude Code keeps that block in an in-memory cache that may flush back and clobber the update. Closing the app eliminates the race. (Slot-file updates done by `sca usage`'s token refresh use `MoveFileEx` with retry, so they survive an open Claude Code on `.credentials.json` itself; but the `~/.claude.json` cache race means you still need to close it for the two write actions.)

## Windows Notes

### Name sanitization
Spaces, Windows-invalid filename characters (`\ / : * ? " < > |` and control chars), PowerShell wildcard brackets (`[` `]`), and parentheses (`(` `)`) are automatically replaced with `_`. Trailing dots are stripped. Reserved Windows device names (`CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`, `NUL`, `COM1`-`COM9`, `LPT1`-`LPT9`) are rejected.

- `my personal` → `my_personal`
- `foo/bar` → `foo_bar`
- `foo[bar]` → `foo_bar_`
- `foo(bar)` → `foo_bar_`
- `foo.` → `foo`
- `CON` → error (reserved device name)

### Profile encoding
`sca install` and `sca uninstall` preserve your PowerShell profile's existing encoding (UTF-8 with or without BOM, UTF-16 LE/BE). ANSI-encoded profiles are treated as UTF-8 no-BOM (indistinguishable without a BOM).

### State file
The active-slot tracker lives at `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\.sca-state.json`; plain JSON, safe to inspect. Schema: `{ schema, active_slot, last_sync_hash }`.

### Execution policy
If you get a security warning on first run, press `Y` or run once as:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned
```

## Testing

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File tests/Invoke-Tests.ps1
```

Pester 5 is auto-installed to `CurrentUser` scope on first use. PSScriptAnalyzer runs in advisory mode if installed. Each test sandboxes `$env:USERPROFILE` and `$PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts` to Pester's `$TestDrive` so your real `.claude\` directory and PowerShell profile are never touched. Exit code follows Pester: `0` on pass, non-zero on any failure.
